# Abstract
This project is aiming to study the Distributed Computing Systems and create a solution to fulfill Distributed System.
\
In current computing system, the reason of building the system with separating computing, may mostly:
1. Sharing information and data for modifying. Since the technology evolution, the flexiably 
2.
